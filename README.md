# üß† RAG PDF Chat with Streamlit

This project allows users to upload PDF files and ask natural language questions about their content. It uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach with **ChromaDB** as the vector store, **Sentence Transformers** for generating embeddings, and **Together.ai** for generating responses using a powerful LLM.

## üîç Overview

- Upload a PDF and parse its content
- Split text into chunks for semantic search
- Generate real embeddings using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- Store and query document chunks in ChromaDB
- Ask questions through a friendly Streamlit chat interface
- Generate context-aware answers using Together.ai LLM (e.g., Mistral-7B)
